//get to the directory you want to the files probably in htdoc in xampp 
//once in the directory in the terminal

git clone https://github.com/aclendenen/Fundamentals.git    //this will get you the files


//if you don't know how branches work you can work on master just dont commit anything unless you know everything is working
//when you are ready to commit heres what you do

git pull 		//this gets the latest copy and will ask you to merge conflict if there is any
git add --all 	//this adds all the new files you should always run this or git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"  //this commits it but it wont show on git until you push
git push origin master    //this will push to master


//branching so that you can save and commit as you go
//after cloning

git branch theNameNewBranch 		//this will create a branch
git checkout branchName				//this is how you checkout the branch / set it to active

//you can now git add --all, git commit -m "", and git push origin branchName as much as you want
//when you are ready to merge do the next steps you may need to commit before checking out master

git checkout master
git pull
git merge urbranchname 			//if there is conflict it will ask you to resolve them
git add . or git add —all
git commit -m "  "
git push origin master

//other commands
git branch 		//this list all of the local branches available
