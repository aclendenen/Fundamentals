-you need to download xampp or something like it idk how to use other ones though
	the address is https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
-once you have xampp you should place the fundamentals folder from git in the htdoc folder
-then run xampp if its not and click on the middle tab and start the apache server
-now go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin and if that doesn't work you may need to start the sqlserver also
-once on http://localhost/phpmyadmin you should be able to run the sql scripts in order to create the fundamentals database
	just copy the scripts in the script tab and hit go then refresh the left bar and the db should be there and viewable
-now you can go to http://localhost/Fundamentals/php/index.php in you browser and you should see our app you can change
	index.php to whatever file path you want and you should see that page unless it redirects you to index
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
-also a side note if you are on mac I've been using textwrangler as my text editor and I like it cause it colors the php and html and you 	can have multiple files open and navigate easy. I also have heard notepad2 on windows is good
